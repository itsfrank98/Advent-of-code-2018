# Advent-of-code-2018
Here I will upload my programs for the Advent of Code 2018, if I think they could be useful for someone. I won't use a specific programming language, each day I will choose it basing on the target I will have to achieve

DAY 1: Due to the lack of time I wrote a very rudimental code, better if I keep that for me :)

DAY 2: Today I decided to use Java after more than 2 years. The task wasn't so hard so it was the perfect occasion to get used again to my favourite programming language

DAY 5: After some tough days I managed to solve the task with an accettable solution. I used Python, which is new to me so if you are beginners this might help you, at least I hope!
