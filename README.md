# Advent-of-code-2018
Here I will upload my programs for the Advent of Code 2018, if I think they could be useful for someone. I won't use a specific programming language, each day I will choose it basing on the target I will have to achieve

Day one: Due to the lack of time I wrote a very rudimental code, better if I keep that for me :)

Day two: Today I decided to use Java after more than 2 years. The task wasn't so hard so it was the perfect occasion to get used again to my favourite programming language
